* When you exit IRB the input history will be saved to irb.log in your current working directory. It will also work if you’ve already run some commands and then paste the above block.
* Here is a quick solution: Create .irbrc file in your home directory and paste following line into it: IRB.conf[:SAVE_HISTORY] = 1000
